  abstract        = {With the advancements in machine and deep learning algorithms, the envision of various critical real-life applications in computer vision becomes possible. One of the applications is facial sentiment analysis. Deep learning has made facial expression recognition the most trending research fields in computer vision area. Recently, deep learning-based FER models have suffered from various technological issues like under-fitting or over-fitting. It is due to either insufficient training and expression data. Motivated from the above facts, this paper presents a systematic and comprehensive survey on current state-of-art Artificial Intelligence techniques (datasets and algorithms) that provide a solution to the aforementioned issues. It also presents a taxonomy of existing facial sentiment analysis strategies in brief. Then, this paper reviews the existing novel machine and deep learning networks proposed by researchers that are specifically designed for facial expression recognition based on static images and present their merits and demerits and summarized their approach. Finally, this paper also presents the open issues and research challenges for the design of a robust facial expression recognition system.},

The important features used to develop the AV system are Named Entity Recognition, Textual Entailment, Question-Answer type Analysis and Chunk Boundary and Dependency relations. Separate AV modules have been developed for each of these features. We first combine the question and the answer into Hypothesis (H) and the Supporting Text as Text (T) to check the entailment relation as either "VALIDA TED" or "REJECTED". The important lexical features used for the Textual Entailment Module in the present system are: WordNet based unigram match, bigram match and skip-gram. The results obtained from the four answer validation modules are integrated using a voting technique. Evaluation scores obtained on the AVE 2008 test set show 67{\%} precision for "VALIDATED" decisions. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {Facial sentiment analysis has been an enthusiastic research area for the last two decades. A fair amount of work has been done by researchers in this field due to its utility in numerous applications such as facial expression driven knowledge discovery. However, developing an accurate and efficient facial expression recognition system is still a challenging problem. Although many efficient recognition systems have been introduced in the past, the recognition rate is not satisfactory in general due to inherent limitations including light, pose variations, noise, and occlusion. In this paper, a hybrid approach of facial expression based sentiment analysis has been presented combining local and global features. Feature extraction is performed fusing the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) descriptor with the uniform local ternary pattern (U-LTP) descriptor. These features are extracted from the entire face image rather than from individual components of faces like eyes, nose, and mouth. The most suitable set ofHOGparameters are selected after analyzing them experimentally along with the ULTP descriptor, boosting performance of the proposed technique over face images containing noise and occlusions. Face sentiments are analyzed classifying them into seven universal emotional expressions: Happy, Angry, Fear, Disgust, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral. Extracted features viaHOGand ULTP are fused into a single feature vector and this feature vector is fed into a Multi-class Support Vector Machine classifier for emotion classification. Three types of experiments are conducted over three public facial image databases including JAFFE, MMI, and CK+ to evaluate the recognition rate of the proposed technique during experimental evaluation; recognition accuracy in percent, i.e., 95.71, 98.20, and 99.68 are achieved for JAFFE, MMI, and CK+, respectively.},

  abstract        = {Human personality has played a vital role in an individual's life as well as in the development of an organization. One of the ways to judge human personality is by using standard questionnaires or by analyzing the Curriculum Vitae (CV). Traditionally, recruiters manually shortlist/filters a candidate‟s CV as per their requirements. In this paper, we present a system that automates the eligibility check and aptitude evaluation of candidates in a recruitment process. To meet this need an online application is developed for the analysis of aptitude or personality test and candidate‟s CV. The system analyzes professional eligibility based on the uploaded CV. The system employs a machine learning approach using TF-IDF Algorithm. The output of our system gives a decision for candidate recommendation. Further, the resulting scores help in evaluating the qualities in the candidates by analyzing the scores obtained in different areas. The graphical analysis of the performance of any candidate makes it easier to evaluate his/her personality and helpful in analyzing the CV properly. Thus, the system provides a helping hand for the recruitment process so that the candidate‟s CV will be shortlisted and the fair decision will be made},

When the collection is extracted from the Web, the structure and style of the texts are quite different from those of newspaper articles. We developed a QA system based on an answer validation process able to handle Web specificity. A large number of candidate answers are extracted from short passages in order to be validated according to question and passages characteristics. The validation module is based on a machine learning approach. It takes into account criteria characterizing both passage and answer relevance at surface, lexical, syntactic and semantic levels to deal with different types of texts. We present and compare results obtained for factual questions posed on a Web and on a newspaper collection. We show that our system outperforms a baseline by up to 48{\%} in MRR. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

Simply keeping the most recent records offers no flexibility about which data is kept, and does not exploit even minimal redundancies in the data (a first step towards pattern discovery). This paper focuses in how to construct and maintain efficiently (in one pass) a compact summary for data such as web logs and text streams. The resulting structure is a prefix tree, with ordering criterion that changes with time, such as an activity time stamp or attribute frequency. A detailed analysis of the factors that affect its performance is carried out, including empirical evaluations using the well known 20 Newsgroups data set. Guidelines for forgetting and tree pruning are also provided. Finally, we use this data structure to discover evolving topics from the 20 Newsgroups. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

Automated recognition of facial reflection also helps to create applications that can be implemented in security system of rules and also for other investigative aim. It also has an emerging impact on Commercial identification and marketing. Facial Expression Recognition systems are mostly based on feature tracking from a video informant. These systems can be implemented using a variety of algorithmic programs such as local binary Pattern and Viola-Jones algorithm. This project presents you a Facial Expression recognition system-“Sentiment Analysis” which uses Viola-jones algorithm to detect face from an image and local binary pattern for expression recognition. For classification of expressions Support vector machine is used. Using facial expression project we can detect a person's facial expression and display weather the person is smiling, sad or shocked. This product framework is intended to first identify and read a persons face. The system then computes various facial parameters of the persons face. After identifying and registering these parameters, the system classifies the expressions for human sadness, smile and human expressions. Based on these statistics the system concludes the person's emotional state.},
